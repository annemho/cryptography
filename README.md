Undergraduate cryptography course material.

These are Anne M. Ho's undergraduate cryptography course materials from 
Coastal Carolina University (CCU). Note: this course is listed as Math 
408 as well as Computer Science 408.

Textbook: Introduction to Cryptography with Coding Theory (2nd Edition) 
by Trappe and Washington.

Credit Hours: 3. This class meets 2 days a week for 1 hour and 15 
minutes during each class session.

Prerequisite: Mathematical Proofs and Problem Solving or Introduction to 
Discrete Math.

Course Information: This is a lecture-based class which introduces 
students to the fundamentals of cryptography and cryptanalysis, 
primarily focusing on data encryption and decryption.

I am teaching this course during the Fall 2016 semester, so new material 
will be updated from now until December.

--Some SageMath code, much of this is based on Kate Stange's (CU 
Boulder) course.  All of my code is short and can be run on https://sagecell.sagemath.org/

Lecture notes are currently handwritten and might be added in the future 
(either as scans or as .tex files). Please contact me (currently at
