Undergraduate cryptography course material.

These are Anne M. Ho's undergraduate cryptography course materials from 
Coastal Carolina University (CCU). Note: this course is listed as Math 
408 as well as Computer Science 408.

Textbook: Introduction to Cryptography with Coding Theory (2nd Edition) 
by Trappe and Washington.

Credit Hours: 3. This class meets 2 days a week for 1 hour and 15 
minutes during each class session.

Prerequisite: Mathematical Proofs and Problem Solving or Introduction to 
Discrete Math.

Course Information: This is a lecture-based class which introduces 
students to the fundamentals of cryptography and cryptanalysis, 
primarily focusing on data encryption and decryption.

I am teaching this course during the Fall 2016 semester, so new material 
will be updated from now until December.

Files (mostly .tex files and necessary files to compile as well as .sagews code)

--Homework assignments (Missions) and solutions

--Handouts and in-class activities

--Syllabus

--Some SageMath code, much of this is based on Kate Stange's (CU 
Boulder) course.  All of my code is short and can be run on https://sagecell.sagemath.org/

Lecture notes are currently handwritten and might be added in the future 
(either as scans or as .tex files). Please contact me (currently at 
aho@coastal.edu) with any questions.
