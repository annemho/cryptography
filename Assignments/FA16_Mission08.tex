\section{Graded Problems}

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
	\item Work through the RSA code (RSA.sagews) on Moodle.  
	\begin{enumerate}[a.]
		\item Notice that if you run the code multiple times, you will end up getting different encrypted text.  In a sentence or two, explain why this is:

		\vspace{2.2in}
		\end{framed}
		\item Encrypt a one-line phrase, and email the input and output to me (please don't write this one by hand!).
	\end{enumerate}
	\newpage \item Part of the RSA lectures was a claim that we can factor $n = pq$ by just knowing $n$ and $\varphi(n)$ (see notes on using a certain polynomial and the quadratic formula).  Write out the details of how you would do this for $n = 27679$.  You can use SageMath for the Euler phi function, but you cannot use it for direct factoring here.
		\begin{framed}
		\vspace{2.5in}
		\end{framed}
	\item Part of the discussion on RSA attacks was a mention of \textbf{continued fractions}.
		\begin{enumerate}[a.]
			\item Read the intro, motivation and notation, and basic formula sections on Wikipedia's continued fractions page: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction}.\\
			\item Write an example of a finite continued fraction here.\\

			\item Explain in a sentence which types of numbers would have an infinite continued fraction.
